# 🎮 GameGear – Java Full Stack E‑commerce (Spring Boot, Spring AI, Stripe)

GameGear is a full‑stack e‑commerce platform built with a **Spring Boot** backend and **React + Vite** frontend.  
This repository is primarily focused on the **backend**: secure APIs, payment processing, AI‑powered image search, and JWT‑based authentication.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

### Backend

- **Framework:** Spring Boot 3 (Java 21)
- **Layers:**
  - **Controller layer** – `controller/*` (e.g. `ProductController`, `AuthController`, `OrderController`, `CartController`)
  - **Service layer** – `service/*` (business logic, image similarity, AI, Stripe payment orchestration)
  - **Repository layer** – `repository/*` (Spring Data JPA over PostgreSQL)
  - **Domain model** – `model/*` (User, Role, Product, Category, Cart, Order, Image, etc.)
  - **DTOs / Requests / Responses** – `dtos/*`, `request/*`, `response/*` (API contracts)
- **Security:**
  - Spring Security with **JWT** (access + refresh tokens)
  - Role‑based authorization (`ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`)
  - Stateless sessions, CORS configuration, and secured URL patterns
- **Data & Persistence:**
  - PostgreSQL as main database
  - JPA + Hibernate
- **AI & Vector Search:**
  - Spring AI + OpenAI
  - Chroma Vector Store for **image similarity search** (e.g. “search products by image”)
- **Payments:**
  - Stripe integration (`stripe-java`) for secure checkout

### Frontend (Summary)

- **Stack:** React 18, Vite, Redux Toolkit
- **UI:** React Bootstrap, MUI, React Toastify
- **Payments:** Stripe Elements
- **Routing:** React Router, protected routes for user/admin dashboards

## 🌐 API Overview

### Live URLs

- **Website:** `https://gamegear.one`

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT‑based auth** with:
  - Access tokens (short‑lived)
  - Refresh tokens (long‑lived)

**Key patterns (/api/v1):**

| Area  | Example pattern                         | Notes                         |
|-------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Auth  | `/auth/**`                              | Login, register, refresh      |
| Users | `/users/**`                             | User profile, registration    |
| Cart  | `/carts/**`, `/cartItems/**`            | Cart operations (secured)     |
| Orders| `/orders/**`                            | Order creation/history        |

### Product API (selected endpoints)

**prefixed with** `/api/v1`:
